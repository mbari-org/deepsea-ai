**DeepSeaAI** is a Python package to simplify processing deep sea video in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) from a command line. 
 
It includes reasonable defaults that have been optimized for deep sea video. The goal is to simplify running these algorithms in AWS.

DeepSea-AI currently supports:

 - *Training [YOLOv5](http://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) object detection* models with up to 8 GPUs using the best available instances in AWS
 - Processing video with [YOLOv5](http://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) detection and tracking pipeline using 
     * [StrongSort](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov5_StrongSORT_OSNet) tracking

The cost to process a video is typically less than **$1.25** per 15-minute video using a model designed for a 640 pixel size.

The cost to run the training algorithm depends on your data size and the number of GPUs you use.A large collection with 30K images and 
300K localizations may cost **$300-$600** to process, depending on the instance you choose to train on. This is reasonably small for a 
research project, and small in comparison to purchasing your own GPU hardware.

## Getting Started
## Install

There are two main requirements to use this:

1.  [An account with AWS Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com).
2.  [An account with Docker](http://docker.com).
3.  Install and update using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/) in a Python>=3.8.0 environment:

After you have setup your AWS account, configure it using the awscli tool  

```
pip install awscli
aws configure
aws --version
```

Then install the module

```shell
pip install -U deepsea-ai
```

Setting up the AWS environment is done with the setup mirror command.  This only needs to be done once, or when you upgrade
the module.   This command will setup the appropriate AWS permissions and mirror the images used in the commands
from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) to your ECR Elastic Container Registry. 

Be patient - this takes a while, but only needs to be run once.

```shell
deepsea-ai setup --mirror
```

## Tutorials

* [FathomNet](docs/notebooks/fathomnet_train.ipynb) âœ¨ Recommended first step to learn more about how to train a YOLOv5 object detection model using freely available FathomNet data

### Create the Anaconda environment

The fastest way to get started is to use the Anaconda environment.  This will create a conda environment called *deepsea-ai* and make that available in your local jupyter notebook as the kernel named *deepsea-ai*

```shell
conda env create 
conda activate deepsea-ai
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=deepsea-ai
```

### Launch jupyter

```
cd docs/notebooks
jupyter notebook
```
---

## Commands

* `deepsea-ai setup --help` - Setup the AWS environment. Must run this once before any other commands.
* [`deepsea-ai train --help` - Train a YOLOv5 model and save the model to a bucket](docs/commands/train.md)
* [`deepsea-ai process --help` - Process one or more videos and save the results to  a bucket](docs/commands/process.md)
* [`deepsea-ai ecsprocess --help` - Process one or more videos using the Elastic Container Service and save the results to a bucket](docs/commands/process.md)
* [`deepsea-ai split --help` - Split your training data. This is required before the train command.](docs/data.md) 
* [`deepsea-ai monitor --help` - Monitor processing. Use this after the ecsprocess train command.](docs/commands/monitor.md)
* `deepsea-ai -h` - Print help message and exit.
